        <h1>Basketball Poem</h1>
        <hr></hr>
        <h2>By <a href="https://twitter.com/brendohare/status/604686667010723840" target="_blank">Brendan O'Hare</a></h2>           
        <br />
        <p>
            Basketball, basketball, basketball, the game of the slam dunk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basketball, basketball, basketball, I hope you'll never be sunk.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The rivers should run orange
        </p>
        <p>
            And let's see a carrot sky too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Little basketball for air particles
        </p>
        <p>
            And tiny Spaldings for the dew.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Dribbling, driving, passing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just some of my favorite things
        </p>
        <p>
            Crash the boards. Shoot that ball.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're as sweet as ten championship rings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The players meet at half-court
        </p>
        <p>
            And shake each others hand
        </p>
        <p>
            But when the ref blows their whislte
        </p>
        <p>
            For himself, every man.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The crowd loves the swish sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            And we go nuts for the mighty jam
        </p>
        <p>
            But if something's not to our liking
        </p>
        <p>
            Opponents beat it and scram.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            We hate the playful mascot
        </p>
        <p>
            The game needs no extra joy
        </p>
        <p>
            Repulsed by the disgusting excess
        </p>
        <p>
            We throw bottles at the costumed boy
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Would you kill for your favorite player?
        </p>
        <p>
            Would you raise your big right hand
        </p>
        <p>
            And tell the smiling judge and jury
        </p>
        <p>
            That you'd do it again?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Michael Jordan you're a high-flier
        </p>
        <p>
            And LeBron James you are too.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day I hope to soar as well
        </p>
        <p>
            So I can glide along with you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Basketball, basketball, basketball, the game of the slam dunk.
        </p>
        <p>
            Basketball, basketball, basketball, I hope you'll never be sunk.
